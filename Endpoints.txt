6. Everything concerning admin
	RESOURCES:
		METHOD TYPE		LOCATION								DESCRIPTION
	1.	POST			/login									For logging in to the app as an admin
	2.	POST			/logout									For logging out of the app as an admin
	
The "Everything concerning admin" is not an entity.. it's just a combination of a few entities like 
	User(all types of users), Authority(that maps users to their UserRoles) and 
	UserRole (the roles of all the types of users)
But I didnt add them here because, there's only one type of User, the admin (also the only User), 
	one type of UserRole, ADMIN, because only the admins will be accessing the app, and only one record for
	Authority, which maps this one admin to the ADMIN role. No one will be accessing this information (at least
	for now) so it won't be displayed anywhere.
	

N/B: Curly braces in the location denote parameters to be appended to the url. So,
		/{firstName}.f denotes a parameter firstName appended to the url, followed by a ".f"
